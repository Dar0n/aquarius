## History

So we have recently discovered that Yelp wants to move his current stack to a new one based on Python/Dajngo and ES6/React, they also want to replace his old fashioned Bootstrap UI framework with a supercool UI. 

For this herculean task they will hire a whole new team and selection process is starting now. A prototype following their wireframes is mandatory for all those that want to participate.
